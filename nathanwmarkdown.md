The June debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump was heralded by American observers as historic and life-changing. In many ways, it was. In a few weeks, the US president's disastrous performance led to the replacement of the Democratic presidential candidate - his vice president Kamala Harris was nominated instead of Biden.

This completely changed the course of the campaign, as Trump's almost guaranteed victory began to slip from his grasp. Harris very soon began to outperform her rival both in the national ratings and at the level of the swing states, where the outcome of the campaign would be determined.

There were several reasons for this. First, the effect of novelty - it turned out that Democratic voters were so tired of Biden's lethargy and constant reservations that his replacement with a young and energetic candidate (Harris is 22 years younger than Biden) brought an electoral effect in itself. Second, Harris immediately ran the campaign very competently, listening to her technologists. Thirdly, her campaign itself took place in a rather greenhouse environment - Harris made public appearances with pre-prepared speeches and to a friendly audience, giving only one major interview to a serious media outlet.

So before the debate with Trump, there was some concern in the Democratic camp about whether Harris would be able to stand up to the seasoned orator Trump, who has much more experience in debating at the highest level.

'Harris set the hook, and Trump took the bait' is the metaphor used by almost all American journalists and commentators on the debate. One of Harris's main tasks was to make her opponent angry, and she succeeded.

Before the debate, it was assumed that Trump would resort to personal attacks on his opponent more often, but in practice, it turned out the opposite: Harris spent 46% of her time criticizing Trump, while he devoted only 29% of his timing to criticizing the Democrat.
